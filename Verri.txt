//Most complex bug on which

couple of months back worked on interesting customer field defect.

1. What was the issue?
	customer facing outage and support bundle got generated. support bundle contains all logs files for example /var/log/message and tintri filesystem specific debug files
 	
2. Analysis:
	
	started analyzing logs and noticed timeouts for many read requests and also noticed queuemonitor timeout for readrequests. Asserion hit for the same and generated dump. 
	before directly going into corefile as i was not familiar with this module started understanding of high level design of requests, connections and sockests 


	Started coredump analysis around socket connection and rpc requests and sockets, there were > 1000 sockets out of which > 800  
	marked errored, ideally if socket marked error, it should be freed from memory.

	that means there is window in cleaning sockets which is not working as expected. 

Root Cuase:
	each socket connection have rpc requests and socket associated, basically its shared_pointer 

	after processing read requests get enqueued to reply queue, but when I print all queue containt still there was alot many reuests were pending for draing response. basically this is the reason sockets were not cleaing up, if sockets gets cleanup, it will close the older connection and will create new one.

	senq_ has rpcRequest ref_
	rpcRequest has rpcConnection ref_
	rpcConnection has rpcSocket ref_

Reproduction:
	wrote unit test to repro the issue.
Fix:
     if socket is marked with error during sending reply, thread will drain all requests from reply queue, in short before fix there was limit how many request will get drained during each iternation, now were not keeping that limit if socket is marked with error.
